_Storing medium for logs_ 

Having used the popular tools [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) & [kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana) before, it sparked my interest in building something simular that I can call my own.  

### The aim
Creating a system that can store logs and easily be implemented. Running in an container and be easy to deploy.
